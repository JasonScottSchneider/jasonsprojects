		<p>I am sorry that this page is bare. The sole purpose for this page is to provide quick access to ongoing projects rather than to be ostentatious for my own self-gratification.</p>

		<h3><center>Built as V10</center></h3>
		<p>This version implements questions after sentence stimuli and exports whether participants answered correctly for the questions following sentences. Linguists will find this necessary to ensure that participants are actively engaged during the experiment, a cognitive load is applied to memory, and participants do not form habits of pressing buttons rapidly like knee jerk reactions.</p>

		<h3><center>Built as V10.2</center></h3>
		<p><strong>Caution is Advised Using V10.2</strong></p>
		<p>I am happy to announce that V10 is undergoing some tested developments. However, I must stress that V10.2 is unstable and is still being developed. The improvement in V10.2 is that experimental data is sent to the investigator's email and online spreadsheet.</p>
